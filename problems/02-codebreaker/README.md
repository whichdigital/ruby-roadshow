## Code Breaker

Agent, we have intercepted some secret messages between two of our rivals; 'Ava J.' and 'S. Cala'. It is vital that we decrypt these messages as soon as possible as we fear that they plan to launch an attack.

We have received a tip off from our trusted ally 'Secret Snake' who has informed us that these messages are somehow related. If we decrypt the first, the rest should follow. He also believes that the first message is encrypted with something known as a 'ROT13' cipher, but we're not sure what that means.

Please help save the day by writing some code to decrypt the following messages:

NINJR ARRQG BZRRG GBQVF PHFFB HECYN AFCYR NFRER CYLON PXJVG UNGVZ RNAQY BPNGV BAVSR NEGUN GBHEP BZZHA VPNGV BAVFO RVATZ BAVGB ERQFB CYRNF RHFRN PNRFN EPVCU RESBE LBHEE RCYLJ RYYHF RLBHE OVEGU QNLNF GURXR LKKKK

Note: Please try not to use existing gems or online forms to solve this problem. We can't trust them and we fear the NSA may be listening. You'll have to implement your own solution.
